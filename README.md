# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on product reviews using a dataset of customer reviews. The analysis involves data exploration, visualization, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the sentiment of the reviews.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Reviews.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- `Id`: A unique identifier for each review.
- `ProductId`: An identifier for the product.
- `UserId`: An identifier for the user who wrote the review.
- `ProfileName`: The name of the user.
- `HelpfulnessNumerator`: The number of users who found the review helpful.
- `HelpfulnessDenominator`: The total number of users who indicated whether the review was helpful.
- `Score`: The rating given by the user (1 to 5).
- `Time`: The timestamp of the review.
- `Summary`: A brief summary of the review.
- `Text`: The full text of the review.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal after installing the necessary libraries.)*

### Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the `analysis.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the analysis.**

## Project Details

### Methodology

The project follows a standard data science and NLP workflow:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: The `Reviews.csv` file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The notebook then displays the first few rows of the data to get a feel for the dataset's structure and content.

2.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Although not explicitly shown in the first few cells, a typical NLP project like this would involve:
    *   Handling missing values.
    *   Removing duplicate reviews.
    *   Cleaning the text data by removing HTML tags, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
    *   **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into individual words (tokens).
    *   **Stop Word Removal**: Removing common words that don't carry much meaning (e.g., "the", "a", "is").
    *   **Stemming or Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The project uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization. This likely involves creating plots to understand:
    *   The distribution of scores (ratings).
    *   The relationship between the length of the review and the score.
    *   The most frequent words in the reviews.

4.  **Sentiment Analysis using NLP**: The use of the `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) library indicates that the project performs sentiment analysis. This could be done in a few ways:
    *   **Rule-based approach**: Using a pre-defined lexicon of words with positive and negative connotations (e.g., "good", "great" are positive, while "bad", "terrible" are negative).
    *   **Machine Learning approach**: Training a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or a more advanced model like an LSTM or Transformer) to predict the sentiment based on the text. The `Score` column would be used to label the training data (e.g., scores 4-5 are positive, 1-2 are negative, and 3 is neutral).

### Tools and Libraries

*   **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **`numpy`**: For numerical operations.
*   **`matplotlib` and `seaborn`**: For data visualization.
*   **`nltk`**: For natural language processing tasks.
*   **Jupyter Notebook**: As the interactive development environment.

### Potential Outcomes and Applications

The analysis performed in this notebook can lead to several valuable outcomes:

*   **Identifying key themes and topics**: Discovering what aspects of the products customers are talking about the most.
*   **Tracking sentiment over time**: Analyzing how customer sentiment changes over time.
*   **Improving products and services**: Using the feedback to identify areas for improvement.
*   **Building a sentiment analysis model**: The code in this notebook could be used to build a model that can automatically classify the sentiment of new reviews.
